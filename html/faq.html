                            <p class="quote">One of our hiring criteria is that all teachers must have completed a certification in English Language Teaching. We consider all applications from candidates that have an English language teaching certification. Your course must be at least 120 hours in-class with 4 hours of observed teaching practice with real students.</p>

                            <p class="quote">We hire all year round, but our busiest period is over summer (Jun-Jul) and the start of the new school year (Sept). May through to October is the peak hiring season for ILA.</p>

                            <p class="quote">As well as many other packaged incentives such as supplements on base pay for teaching certain classes etc.</p>
                            <p class="quote">Many teachers prefer this is as it rewards our current staff who want to stay at ILA rather than only new staff.</p>

                            <p class="quote">We use the following to define a native speaker: </p>
                            <p class="quote">A native speaker is someone who has spoken English from early childhood. It’s the language they used at school and with their family. Many people grow up speaking 2 languages and are bilingual, which would also qualify as a native speaker. All teachers must have native speaker mastery of English in all skills [including pronunciation].</p>
                            <p class="quote">We welcome all qualified, native level English teachers who pass our interviewing and screening processes.</p>

                            <p class="signature">Accommodation</p>
                            <p class="quote">When overseas teachers first arrive we will pick you up at the airport and put you up in a hotel for 10 nights. After that, housing in Vietnam is cheap, diverse, flexible and easy to find.</p>
                            <p class="quote">Whether you are looking to save money and live modestly or want to enjoy the high life in luxury serviced apartments, you are sure to find something suitable in a short space of time.</p>
                            <p class="quote">For short-term accommodation there are various available options you can find, ranging from low priced guest houses, to mid-range hotels, to top end resorts all around the country.</p>
                            <p class="quote">For long-term accommodation you may want to opt for a shared apartment or house or alternatively you can find individual serviced apartments. When looking for long-term accommodation we generally suggest consulting one of the reliable housing agents around town.</p>
                            <p class="quote">Once you have found a place that suits you it is time to sign the contract and pay the deposit. Contracts are usually one year long and include a detailed inventory and the terms of payment. The deposit is usually two or three months rent which is returned at the end of the lease. The process of finding a place to live is comparable to most western systems except that you can expect the process to be much faster and a great deal less expensive.</p>
                            <p class="quote">For candidates joining ILA’s Level 5 TEFL course and opting for the accommodation package, we will arrange for 29 nights of stay in a comfortable, convenient guesthouse close to the training centre.</p>
